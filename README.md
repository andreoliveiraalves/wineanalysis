  Abstract:
  
1. Jupiter Notebook project, with the implementation of different machine algorithms with the aim to classify a wine between red/wine based on their properties. 
2. This project has been fed with a dataset with 6493 with their properties and final classification.

  Objectives:

1. If there was no classification how would an unsupervised machine learning algorithm classify our wines based on the present data.

2. Creation of a prediction model with various algorithms and further analysis.
